# 018-badger-approval

## Source context
Derived as a minimal recreation pattern inspired by public reports on **BadgerDAO**.

## Intended vulnerability class
- Primary class: unchecked-return
- Expected severity: high

## What this case tests
This case checks whether a tool can identify the core exploit mechanism under simplified but realistic DeFi logic.

## Notes
- This is a benchmark recreation, not full protocol code.
- Keep logic minimal and deterministic for reproducible scoring.
