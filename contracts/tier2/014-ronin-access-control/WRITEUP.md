# 014-ronin-access-control

## Source context
Derived as a minimal recreation pattern inspired by public reports on **Ronin Bridge**.

## Intended vulnerability class
- Primary class: access-control
- Expected severity: critical

## What this case tests
This case checks whether a tool can identify the core exploit mechanism under simplified but realistic DeFi logic.

## Notes
- This is a benchmark recreation, not full protocol code.
- Keep logic minimal and deterministic for reproducible scoring.
