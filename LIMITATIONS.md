# LIMITATIONS

- v0.1 uses simplified matching rules (class + location fuzzy).
- Severity can be context-dependent; we use canonical benchmark labels.
- Tier 2 recreations are minimal patterns, not full protocol complexity.
- Confidence scores are recorded but not yet calibrated in scoring.
- Tool-specific adapters may introduce reporting bias.

Planned improvements:
- richer semantic matching
- confidence calibration
- expanded tier3 corpus
